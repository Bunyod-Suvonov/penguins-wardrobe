The repository is a modified version of penguins-wardrobe by @pieroproietti. The repository aims to be a theme for the linux distribution made for UM-SJTU JI

The repository contains only one rendor named TelOS. The TelOS theme is modified to the theme of Debian 12 bookworm to be used by the live iso of JI's distro.

Original README:
# penguins-wardrobe

It is a repository mainly consisting of .yaml files and simple bash scripts used by eggs to create customizations of Linux systems starting from a minimal image - referred to as "naked" - to achieve a complete system.

It's too hard and long for me to have differents translation of this documentation, so I decided to write it in italian and give just a translation link.
